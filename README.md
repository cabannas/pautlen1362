# Compiler Craft - Automata Theory and Languages Project

## Description
"Compiler Craft" is a comprehensive project developed for the "Automata Theory and Languages" course as part of the Computer Engineering program. This endeavor involved creating a full-fledged compiler that includes all the necessary components, such as a syntactic analyzer, a lexico-semantic analyzer, and a defined alphabet. Developed using C for the core logic and assembly language for critical performance sections, this project aims to provide a practical understanding of compiler construction principles.

### Prerequisites
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) for compiling C code
- An assembler for the specific assembly language used (e.g., NASM, GAS)
- Knowledge of compiler design and automata theory

## Development Team
These projects were collaboratively developed by Daniel Cabanas and Alejandro Martin, students of the "Automata Theory and Languages" course, showcasing their commitment to exploring the vast field of automata theory.
